# SportsOdds

Welcome to my Sports Odds gem. The gem scrapes a page for NFL sports gambling odds. The user can pick from a list of booking companies and a list of sports teams to receive sports gambling odds. This is just one part of a larger side project so please be patient and Iâ€™ll eventually bring you more sports, teams, and other information to pick from.
